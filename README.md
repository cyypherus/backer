A library for straight-forward UI layout.

Dependency free & framework-agnostic. Backer can be used in an index-based layout approach or with inline drawing code.

_This library **only** implements layout & could be integrated with a range of UI crates._

### Features

- Declarative API
- Minimal interface
- Single pass layout

### Status

The crate is currently usable but is very new! Currently lacks docs / testing & will likely publish breaking changes often.

Contribution welcome!
