# Backer
A library for straight-forward UI layout. 

Dependency free & framework-agnostic. Backer can be used in an index-based layout approach or with inline drawing code.

*This library **only** implements layout & could be integrated with a range of UI crates.*

###  Features
- Declarative API
- Minimal interface
- Single pass layout

### Status
The crate is currently usable but is very new! Currently lacks docs / testing & will likely publish breaking changes often. 

Contribution welcome!
